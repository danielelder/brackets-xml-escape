# brackets-xml-escape
Brackets extension to escape and unescape xml

## Overview

This is a very simple (and limited) extension to solve a particular problem I had where files containing a mix of escaped and unescaped content.

This has resulted in the escape and unescape functions behaving differently (see usage below)

## Getting Started

Download the extension and install via the Extension Manager.

## Usage

The extension added 2 new options under the Edit menu:

### XML Escape

This will escape all the selected text in the editor window. If more than one selection is made only the first will be escaped.

### XML Unescape

This will unescape all the text in the editor window.
